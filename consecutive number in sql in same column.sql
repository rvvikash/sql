In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.



with cte as (
select id,num,row_number() over(order by id)-row_number() over (partition by num order by id) as rn
from logs)
select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from cte group by rn,num
having count(*)>=3'


 PARTITION BY groups all equal values, not consecutive ones

 firstly it created partition by num so assign value after order it change the place .
