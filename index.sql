Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index

In a table, there can be only one clustered index or  there can be 
one or more than one non_clustered index.

  clustered index:

Definition: A clustered index determines the physical order of data in the table. In other words, the rows are stored on disk in the same order as the clustered index.
  
Unique Constraint: Each table can have only one clustered index because the data can be sorted in only one way.
  
Primary Key: By default, the primary key of a table is often used as the clustered index. However, this is not mandatory.
  
Performance: Clustered indexes can improve performance for queries that retrieve a range of values or involve sorting. Since the data is physically ordered, it can be retrieved more efficiently.

  Non clustered index:

Definition: A non-clustered index is a separate structure from the data table. It creates a logical order of the data but does not alter the physical order of the data in the table.
Multiple Indexes: A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes, each potentially optimizing different types of queries.
Structure: It contains pointers to the data rows, which means it creates a separate data structure that references the location of the actual data in the table.
Performance: Non-clustered indexes can improve query performance by providing quick access to data without affecting the physical storage of the data. However, they can be less efficient for range queries compared to clustered indexes.

when we create a primary key then it automatically behave as index  / Clustered Index:.

if there is no index define in table it will scan full scan to retrive the data.


B-tree indexes organize data in a balanced tree structure,
allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);





unique index:
  A unique index in SQL ensures that the values in a specified column or set of columns are unique across the table. This means that no two rows can have the same combination of values in the indexed columns.
  Unique indexes are often used to enforce data integrity and prevent duplicate entries in a database table
  example :--
  suppose you have a table named employees with columns emp_id and emp_email, and you want to ensure that each email address is unique across the table.
  You can create a unique index on the emp_email column like this:

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_emp_id_email
ON employees (emp_id, emp_email);


composite index:
A composite index in SQL is an index that spans multiple columns in a table. It allows you to create an index on a combination of two or more columns, which can improve the efficiency of queries that involve filtering, sorting, or joining data based on those columns.
  Composite indexes are particularly useful when queries frequently involve conditions that reference multiple columns.

  For example, suppose you have a table named employees with columns department_id, salary, and hire_date, and you frequently run queries that filter or sort data based on both the department_id and hire_date columns.
  You can create a composite index on these columns like this:
example:
CREATE INDEX idx_department_hiredate
ON employees (department_id, hire_date);


NOTE :primary key automatically behave as index ;

BITMAP INDEX:
Bitmap indexes are most effective for columns with low cardinality, where the number of distinct values is relatively small compared to the total number of rows in the table.
They are commonly used in data warehousing and decision support systems to improve query performance for analytical queries and reporting.
example:
CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_department_id
ON employees (department_id);

| emp_id | emp_name | department_id |
|--------|----------|---------------|
|   101  |   Alice  |       1       |
|   102  |   Bob    |       2       |
|   103  |   Carol  |       1       |
|   104  |   David  |       3       |
|   105  |   Emma   |       2       |


| department_id | Bitmap                |
|---------------|-----------------------|
|       1       | 1 1 0 0 0             |
|       2       | 0 0 1 0 1             |
|       3       | 0 0 0 1 0             |


ndex Type	Best For	Example
Clustered Index	Range queries and sorting	CREATE TABLE employees (emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY, emp_name VARCHAR(100));

Non-Clustered Index	Quick lookups, not for range queries	CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON employees (emp_name);

Unique Index	Preventing duplicates	CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_emp_email ON employees (emp_email);

Composite Index	Queries using multiple columns	CREATE INDEX idx_department_hiredate ON employees (department_id, hire_date);

Bitmap Index	Low cardinality columns (e.g., gender, status)	CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_department_id ON employees (department_id);

Primary Key Index	Enforcing uniqueness and automatic indexing	CREATE TABLE employees (emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY, emp_name VARCHAR(100));

B-tree Index	Fast lookups, range queries, and sorting	CREATE INDEX idx_emp_id_btree ON employees (emp_id);

**SQL Indexing Summary with Examples and Interview Questions**

---

### üìò What is an Index?
- An index in SQL is used to speed up the retrieval of rows by using a pointer.
- It works like an index in a book‚Äîquickly locates the data instead of scanning all pages (rows).

---

### üîπ Clustered Index
- **Definition**: Determines the physical order of data in a table.
- **Only one per table**.
- **Automatically created** on primary key unless specified otherwise.
- **Best for**: Range queries, sorting, and retrieving ordered data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY, -- Clustered index by default
    emp_name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

### üîπ Non-Clustered Index
- **Definition**: Logical order only; data order remains unchanged.
- **Can have multiple per table**.
- **Contains pointers** to actual rows.
- **Best for**: Lookup queries.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name
ON employees (emp_name);
```

---

### üîπ Unique Index
- Ensures values in the column(s) are unique.
- Helps maintain data integrity.

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_emp_email
ON employees (emp_email);
```

---

### üîπ Composite Index
- Indexes multiple columns together.
- **Best for**: Queries using WHERE clause with multiple columns.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department_hiredate
ON employees (department_id, hire_date);
```

---

### üîπ Bitmap Index
- Best for **low cardinality** (few distinct values).
- Used in **data warehousing**.

```sql
CREATE BITMAP INDEX idx_department_id
ON employees (department_id);
```

| department_id | Bitmap Representation    |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| 1             | 1 1 0 0 0                |
| 2             | 0 0 1 0 1                |
| 3             | 0 0 0 1 0                |

---

### üîπ B-Tree Index
- Most common type.
- **Best for**: Range queries, lookups, and sorting.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_id_btree
ON employees (emp_id);
```

---

### üö® When to Use Indexing?
‚úÖ Use indexing when:
- You frequently query/filter/sort by specific columns.
- Joins on foreign keys.
- Columns are often used in WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY.

üö´ Avoid indexing:
- On columns with **high update/delete frequency**.
- On columns with **low selectivity** (many repeated values).

---

### ‚úÖ How to Identify Indexing Needs?
- Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check query performance.
- Look for **Full Table Scans** ‚Äî sign that indexing might help.
- Monitor query time and slow query logs.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Comparison Before and After Indexing

**Without Index**:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_name = 'Alice';
-- Output: Full Table Scan
```

**With Index**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON employees(emp_name);
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_name = 'Alice';
-- Output: Index Lookup
```

**Query Execution Time (approx.)**
| Condition        | Execution Time |
|------------------|----------------|
| Without Index    | 120ms          |
| With Index       | 5ms            |

This shows a significant speed improvement in large datasets.

### üí¨ Interview Questions and Answers

**Q1. What is the difference between clustered and non-clustered index?**
- Clustered index changes the physical order of data; non-clustered does not.
- Only one clustered index allowed; many non-clustered indexes can be created.

**Q2. When would you use a composite index?**
- When queries filter or join based on multiple columns.

**Q3. What is a unique index and how is it different from a primary key?**
- Both enforce uniqueness. A primary key cannot be NULL, while a unique index can be (if not explicitly made NOT NULL).

**Q4. What are bitmap indexes best used for?**
- Low cardinality fields like gender, department, or status flags in OLAP systems.

**Q5. How do indexes affect INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations?**
- These operations become slower since indexes must be updated along with the data.

**Q6. What is index selectivity?**
- Ratio of the number of distinct values in a column to the total number of rows. Higher selectivity = better index performance.

**Q7. How does SQL decide to use an index or not?**
- SQL optimizer evaluates the cost of using an index vs. full scan. It chooses the most efficient method.

**Q8. Can a table have multiple clustered indexes?**
- No. Only one clustered index is allowed per table.

**Q9. How do you choose which columns to index?**
- Analyze frequently used columns in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses.

**Q10. What‚Äôs the difference between a composite index and multiple single-column indexes?**
- Composite index is faster for queries involving all indexed columns in the order they appear. Single indexes don‚Äôt perform as well when multiple conditions are involved.

**Q11. Do indexes consume storage?**
- Yes. Indexes are stored as separate objects and consume disk space.

**Q12. Can indexing slow down a system?**
- Yes, too many indexes increase storage and slow down DML operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).

**Q13. How to check if indexing is working?**
- Use `EXPLAIN` to check if a query uses index scan or full table scan.

**Q14. What is a covering index?**
- An index that includes all columns needed for a query, allowing it to be served entirely from the index.

**Q15. What happens if we index every column?**
- System performance degrades due to excessive maintenance on DML operations and storage overhead.

**Q16. Give an example showing performance improvement after indexing.**
- Before: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE
