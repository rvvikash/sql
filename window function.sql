RANK() functions assign a unique rank to each distinct row in the result set, with tied rows receiving the same rank and leaving gaps in subsequent ranks. For example, if two rows tie for first place, the next row will receive a rank of 3.

On the other hand, DENSE_RANK() also assigns ranks based on criteria, but it does not leave gaps between ranks in case of tied rows. This
