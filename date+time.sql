2. Formatting Dates
Use DATE_FORMAT() to format dates:

SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(your_date_column, '%W') AS DayOfWeek,
  DATE_FORMAT(your_date_column, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') AS FullDateTime
FROM your_table
WHERE WEEKDAY(your_date_column) BETWEEN 0 AND 4;
%W = Weekday name

%Y-%m-%d = Date

%H:%i:%s = Time (Hour:Minute:Second)

🕒 3. Get Current Date & Time

SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date;
SELECT NOW() AS current_datetime;
➕➖ 4. Add or Subtract Time
Add Time:

SELECT DATE_ADD('2025-02-07', INTERVAL 10 DAY) AS future_date;
SELECT DATE_ADD('2025-02-07', INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS one_month_later;

Subtract Time:

SELECT DATE_SUB('2025-02-07', INTERVAL 10 DAY) AS past_date;
SELECT DATE_SUB('2025-02-07', INTERVAL 2 WEEK) AS two_weeks_earlier;
📆 5. Calculating Date Differences
Days Between Dates:

SELECT DATEDIFF('2025-02-07', '2025-01-01') AS days_difference;
Date Difference in Units:

SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, '2025-01-01', '2025-02-07') AS days_diff;
SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH, '2024-01-01', '2025-02-07') AS months_diff;
⏰ 6. Working with Time
Format Time:

SELECT TIME_FORMAT('18:30:00', '%H:%i') AS formatted_time;
Convert Seconds to Time:

SELECT SEC_TO_TIME(3661) AS time_value;  -- Output: 01:01:01
🧮 7. Time Difference

SELECT TIMEDIFF('18:00:00', '12:00:00') AS time_diff;  -- Output: 06:00:00
📊 8. Last 10 Days Sales Example
Method 1: Using DATE_ADD():

SELECT SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales_last_10_days
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date >= DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL -10 DAY);
Method 2: Using DATEDIFF():

SELECT SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales_last_10_days
FROM sales
WHERE DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, sale_date) <= 10;
📅 9. Weekday Filtering
WEEKDAY(date) returns:
Monday=0, ..., Sunday=6

Filter Only Weekdays:

SELECT * FROM sales
WHERE WEEKDAY(sale_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 4;
Filters records from Monday to Friday, excluding weekends.
