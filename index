Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index
In a table, there can be only one clustered index or one or more than one non_clustered index.
In Clustered index, there is no separate index storage but in Non-Clustered index, there is separate index storage for the index.
Clustered index offers faster data access, on the other hand, the Non-clustered index is slower.
